# 32-bit MIPS CPU Simulator
This project simulates an actual 32 bit MIPS CPU, adapted from a previous project building the same CPU in Verilog.  The user can download this repo, write a MIPS program in program.asm, run "make run", and the program will print all the register values. NOTE: as of now, it can only correctly output simple arithemtic programs.
